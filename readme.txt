We wanted to revisit the classic look of scattered Polaroids and bring it to a next, flat level with some nice effects. The resulting gallery shows some Polaroid videos with a title, randomly rotated and spread in a container in the main gallery. When navigating the videos, the current one will be moved to the center and the resting Polaroids will move to the sides. Gallery in the popup you can also find a Link button which takes to another page. Optionally, we’ll have a backside for each Polaroid which can be viewed by clicking the current dot of the navigation again. The indication for an existing backside will be a rotated arrow on the dot. Once the dot is clicked again, the dot itself will flip and so will the Polaroid, revealing the description on the back.
